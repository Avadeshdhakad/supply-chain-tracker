# Supply Chain Tracker

## Project Description
The Supply Chain Tracker is a blockchain-based solution designed to provide transparency and traceability in the lifecycle of products as they move through the supply chain. Using a minimal smart contract, each product's origin, status updates, and ownership changes are securely recorded on-chain.

## Project Vision
To create a decentralized and trustless ecosystem where producers, suppliers, and consumers can track the journey of a product with full confidence in the authenticity and data integrity.

## Key Features
- 🔐 **Decentralized Product Registration**: Add products to the blockchain with a unique ID, owner, and initial status.
- 🔄 **Secure Product Updates**: Only the current owner can update the product’s status and transfer ownership.
- 📜 **Immutable Records**: All transactions are stored on-chain, enabling traceability and accountability.

## Future Scope
- 🌐 **Frontend Dashboard**: Develop a web interface using React and Web3.js to visualize and interact with the supply chain data.
- 📦 **Batch Product Tracking**: Extend the contract to support bulk operations and tracking at the pallet or container level.
- 🧠 **Smart Analytics**: Use AI to analyze supply chain data for inefficiencies and fraud detection.
- 🔗 **Integration with IoT Devices**: Automate status updates using IoT sensors for real-time tracking.
